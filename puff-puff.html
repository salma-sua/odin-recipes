    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (+1-2 tablespoons (475ml) warm water</li>
        <li>2¼ teaspoon (7g) active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>3½ cups (420g) flour</li>
        <li>½-¾ cup (100-150g) sugar</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon (8-9g) salt</li>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix salt, sugar, water, and yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour and mix.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture rise for approximately 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, pour vegetable oil into a pot until it's at least 3 inches (about 5cm) deep and heat on low. Too little oil will result in flatter balls.</li>
        <li>Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If it is not hot enough, the batter stays at the pot's bottom rather than rising to the top.</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot enough, grab a little bit of the mixture with your hands or use a spoon to get a small ball of dough. Drop it carefully into the oil.</li>
        <li>Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the ball over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Use a large spoon or something like that to take it out of the oil. I usually place them on napkins immediately to soak up the excess oil.</li>
        <li>If desired, you can roll the finished product in table sugar or powdered sugar to make it sweeter</li>
    </ol>
